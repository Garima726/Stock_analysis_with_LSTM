# Stock_analysis_with_LSTM

Here, in the uploaded notebook, I have analysed the stocks of GOogle, Apple, and Meta. I have created some graphs for Opening and Closing stocks and analysed the behaviours of stocks. 

I have built linear regression models and neural networks with LSTM.

CSV files for all stocks are attached with this.
